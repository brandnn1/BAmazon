# BAmazon

## Overview
BAmazon, like like Amazon is a digital storefront. BAmazon offers different capabilities to different user levels: Customers, Managers and Supervisors. 

Below are examples of how you would interact with this application. Note: This application requires both mysql and inquirer npm bits to be installed



#### -Customer View-

node bamazonCustomer.js

This Customer view is very simplistic. It allows a user to select a product available to them

then select how many of those units they would like to purchase.

A check is done to ensure there is available stock and if there is, it "purchases" the item in the quantity given.

Otherwise it provides a message that there is insufficient stock

![Unit Check Failure Capture](/Images/CustomerUnitsFail.PNG)

After purchase is complete, the inventory is modified to accurately reflect the remaining stock available, and a column is updated which tallies how many units have been sold. 

#### -Manager View-

node bamazonManager.js

The Manager View gets a bit more complex. This view has the ability to do the following:
 View overall products for sale
 
 Viewing only items that are low in inventory
 
 Adding new inventory to existing products
 
 Adding new products available for sale

#### -Custom-
Additionally this application supports making API calls directly from a text file. The first input in the file will be the api you want to call (in it's above naming convention) and the second input will be your search parameters. Currently the file is configured to make a spotify call

node liri.js random-call
